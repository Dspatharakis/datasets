datasets for the paper Distributed Resource Autoscaling in Kubernetes Edge Clusters
Regarding the kNN models, used in the Application Profiling Modeling a hyperparameter tuning is performed, using 10-fold cross-validation, which is a typical ML modeling optimization technique. The basic hyperparameters of kNN are (i) the k parameter, which determines the number of neighbors that are taken into account to classify a new sample, (ii) the distance measurement between the sample points (e.g. euclidean), and (iii) the weight for the distance. After the optimization, the hyperparameters configuration is: (1) for the small resource profile: k=2, distance=euclidean and weight= 1/distance, (ii) for the medium: $k=1$, distance=euclidean and weight=uniform and (iii) for the big k=16, distance=manhattan and weight= 1/distance.
